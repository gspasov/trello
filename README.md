# Purpose
The main goal of this project is to showcase how Svelte works by implementing a Trello "clone". Of course it's related to actually learning Svelte at the same time. This project is not supposed to cover all features of Trello, yet it can get as far as we want to take it.

*You could learn more about what is Svelte [here](https://svelte.dev/)*.

## Setup
This project has been setup by following the [Svelte guidelines](https://svelte.dev/blog/the-easiest-way-to-get-started) using the following commands:
```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template trello
cd trello
node scripts/setupTypeScript.js
```
*Another way you could setup a Svelte project is by using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).*

## Run it
```bash
git clone git@github.com:quanterall/trello.git
cd trello
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Contribution
If you have the desire to work with/learn Svelte you can work on this project as well. I'll try to setup tasks in the **issues** tab, so if you feel like implementing something, just assign yourself to it, or just send a message to *Georgi Spasov* who is "leading" this endevor (at least for the time being).
So just take an **issue** (if there is such, if not, send me a DM and we'll discuss your ideas), work on it, setup a PR and mark *Georgi Spasov* as a reviewer.

## Misc
This project actually uses one of our first TypeScript libraries **[lich](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quanterall/lich)**. So if you want to see how **lich** is practically being used in a project, this is the right place to be.
